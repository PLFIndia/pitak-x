# Magazines / item kinds — progress log (session handoff)

Plan: `docs/plans/magazines.md` (revision 5). Protocol: Part B of the plan.
**Read this file first in every session; update it as the last action of
every session; commit it with the session's commit.**

## State

- Last completed session: **S0** (baseline recorded)
- Branch: `magazines` — working tree clean: **yes**
- Last commit: `9ca2dba` (plan rev 5) at S0 start; S0's own commit follows it
- Full suite last green at: **S0, 2026-10-21** (`flutter test --exclude-tags golden`)
- Baseline numbers (from S0): tests = **2426 passed, 0 failed**
  (goldens excluded), duration = **86 s**, platform-golden failures = **7**
  (all in `test/golden/key_screens_test.dart`, pixel diffs ≤ 2.4 % — the
  Linux-pinned goldens of CHANGELOG 1.5.2; verify in CI, not a blocker).
- `gen` at baseline: `Built with build_runner in 25s; wrote 1136 outputs`,
  no diff.

### How the gates are run on this machine (S0 findings)

- **Use the FVM-pinned SDK.** `pubspec.lock` pins Flutter **3.44.2**
  (`.fvmrc`); the `flutter` on `PATH` is 3.41.1 and `build_runner` refuses
  to resolve with it. Prefix every command with
  `export PATH="$PWD/.fvm/flutter_sdk/bin:$PATH"` (or use `fvm flutter` /
  `fvm dart`).
- **`analyze` is CI-scoped:** `flutter analyze lib test integration_test`
  (exactly what `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs). A bare `dart analyze` from
  the repo root reports 43 pre-existing errors inside the vendored
  `rust_builder/cargokit/build_tool/` (its own pub deps are not fetched) plus
  3 `sort_pub_dependencies` infos in `pubspec.yaml` — none of them ours.
  Format gate: `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test integration_test`.
- **Goldens:** the project defines the `golden` tag (`dart_test.yaml`), so
  `full` on macOS is `flutter test --exclude-tags golden`; the golden-only run
  writes diffs to the git-ignored `test/golden/failures/`.

## Next session

**S1 — Rename `Book` → `CatalogueItem`.** Nothing in flight. Follow the
plan's S1 steps verbatim.

Notes for it: `git grep` on this macOS build does not support `\b`; use
`git grep -P '\bBook\b'` (PCRE) or `grep -rnw` for the identifier census.

## Deviations from plan

_(None yet. Record as: `S<n>` — what the plan said — what was done instead —
why. A deviation is a decision; the next planning step reconciles it.)_

## Open issues / blocked

_(None yet. Record the exact failing command and the first lines of its
output. Platform-golden failures go here tagged "verify in CI".)_
